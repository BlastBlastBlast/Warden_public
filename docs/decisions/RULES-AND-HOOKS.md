# Rules and hooks — names, functions, and what is wired

## Hooks

Blocking behaviour is the column that matters. `deny` stops the tool call. `ask` turns it into a
prompt. `report` writes text back and changes nothing.

| Hook | Event | Function | Blocks? | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `guard-secrets.sh` | PreToolUse Write\|Edit | Denies a write carrying one of three high-confidence secret shapes: a `BEGIN PRIVATE KEY` header, an `AKIA`/`ASIA` AWS key id, or a bearer token of 32+ chars. Skips `fixtures/`, `testdata/`, `*.example`, `*.sample`. Names the shape, never the value. | **deny** | **KEPT, wired** |
| `guard-secrets-read.sh` | PreToolUse Bash | Denies a shell command that puts a secret file's contents in front of the model. Exists because `permissions.deny` on Read is not extended to every Bash command — measured 2026-09-14 against 2.1.270, `cat .env` is blocked but `head -1 .env` returns the secret. Excludes `ls`/`stat`/`wc` (metadata), `cp`/`mv` (moving is not reading), and `.env.example` and friends. | **deny** | **KEPT, wired** |
| `guard-default-branch.sh` | PreToolUse Write\|Edit\|NotebookEdit | Denies a file edit while HEAD is the repo's default branch, and prints the `git switch -c` command. | **deny** | **scrapped — file kept, not wired.** See note below. |
| `guard-test-files.sh` | PreToolUse Write\|Edit | Prompts before editing a test that already exists. A new test never prompts. An edit whose `old_string` survives inside `new_string` is growth, not weakening, and passes. | ask | scrapped, not imported |
| `guard-stage-order.sh` | PreToolUse Write\|Edit | Denies writing a stage artifact before the previous stage finished — no `spec.md` without `intent.md`. | deny | scrapped, not imported |
| `guard-protected-paths.sh` | PreToolUse Write\|Edit | Denies edits to paths a project declares in `.claude/guardrails.json`. No-ops when undeclared. | deny | scrapped, not imported |
| `claude-guard-destructive` | PreToolUse Bash | Blocks `curl`/`wget` piped into a shell, in its common forms, which a static glob cannot match. | deny | scrapped, not imported |
| `claude-guard-agent-dispatch` | PreToolUse Agent | Requires a generic subagent dispatch to name a `model`, so mechanical work does not run on the session's expensive model. | deny | scrapped, not imported |
| `plan-drift.sh` | Stop | Reports when the working tree touches files `plan.md` does not name. Guards its own re-entry so the report does not repeat on every Stop. | report | scrapped, not imported |
| `config-drift.sh` | Stop | Reports when live `settings.json` drifts from its committed state, because Claude Code rewrites that file at runtime and a long session can revert it. | report | scrapped, not imported |
| `ste-lint-spec.sh` | PostToolUse Write\|Edit | Lints spec and plan documents against the spec-language rules. Advisory. | report | scrapped, not imported |
| `.orca/agent-hooks` blob | 8 events | Third-party Orca injection, base64 PowerShell inside a shell `case`. | — | stripped |

Wired now: **two hooks, both secret guards.** Everything else is out.

Two of the scrapped ones never blocked anything — `plan-drift.sh` and `config-drift.sh` only write
text back. They are out anyway because both belong to the chain, and `config-drift.sh` assumes
`~/.claude/settings.json` is a symlink into a repo.

### Note on the default-branch guard

Scrapping it drops enforcement of your own rule 2, "never work directly in main, branch first".
The rule still exists as prose in `CLAUDE.md`, which is a request rather than a guarantee. Three ways
to go, your call:

1. **Leave it scrapped.** The prose rule carries it.
2. **Rewire as-is.** It denies the first edit and prints the branch command. One block per branch,
   then silence.
3. **Make it report instead of deny.** Exit 0 with `additionalContext` telling Claude to branch.
   Never blocks, and Claude nearly always acts on it.

## Rules

Rules never block. They are context. The cost is that an unscoped rule loads in every session.

| Rule | Scope | Function | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|
| `instruction-files.md` | `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `SKILL.md`, rules, settings | Which tier to put guidance in — the same conclusion `ARCHITECTURE.md` reached, already written and already path-scoped. | **Keep. Supersedes our `skill-authoring.md`.** |
| `tests.md` | test-file globs | How to write a test: what to assert, what not to mock, when a test is weakened. | **Keep.** Free unless you are in a test file. |
| `spec-language.md` | spec/plan/ADR paths | One normative keyword per requirement, one reading per sentence. | Keep if you keep the chain. |
| `change-records.md` | `docs/changes/**` | The `docs/changes/<YYYY-MM>-<slug>/` layout and what each artifact holds. | Keep if you keep the chain. |
| `model-selection.md` | **always on** | Opus plans and reviews, Sonnet executes a fully specified task, Opus takes over when something is unknown. | **Keep.** 28 lines, and it is the cost control. |
| `response-style.md` | **always on** | How to talk to you: answer last or first but never both, say each fact once, match detail to task size, reference codes when listing 3+ items. | Overlaps our output style. See below. |
| `research.md` (ours) | **always on** | Source tiers, when to research instead of recall, citation format. | **Keep.** Nothing else covers it. |
| `skill-authoring.md` (ours) | `**/SKILL.md` | How to write a skill. | **Drop.** `instruction-files.md` covers it and more. |

Always-on rules after this: `model-selection.md`, `research.md`, and whatever wins the style slot —
roughly 120 lines on top of `CLAUDE.md`.

### The style overlap

`response-style.md` (rule, 52 lines) and `output-styles/plain-technical.md` (output style, 52 lines)
both load every turn and both say how to write. The rule has one thing the output style lacks:
**reference codes for lists of three or more**, which is why this document numbers nothing and the
tables above name every row. Folding that into the output style leaves one surface instead of two.
